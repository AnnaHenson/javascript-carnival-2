# Whack-a-Mole

### Learning Competencies

- Using Javascript to work with HTML tables
- The onClick() method.
- Playing audio with Javascript

## Summary

The Javascript Carnival has a mole problem! But it's the opposite problem to the one you're picturing; there aren't _enough_ moles. None in fact! Use your Javascript skills to write functions that randomly pop up a mole, then pop it back up somewhere else again after it has been whacked.
