# Notes on JS Carnival

Make sure .vs is out of your code @joseph!
Only one clone which is nice, but idk how I feel about having it all in one repo. maybe positively?

## README
File should be in caps...
JS Carvinal..

#### Learning Competencies
Learning competencies need to be broken up. 
Will this be in separate files like the kata or all in one?
Need to compare mine/calc learning competencies to these. Are there any key ones we're missing?
Edit competencies phrasing?

#### Summary
Love the intro. Could be expanded on to actually give overview of what will be required in challenge.

#### Timebox
This is a very short amount of time..... assuming it is replacing a 15/20 hour challenge(?). 
What will we be removing? How much content will there be?
(Replacement for calc but keep minesweeper?)

#### The Games
love the context, needs rewording

#### Reflection
`and add your reflections` >>  `and answer the reflections` - they should already be there


## squirt-the-readme
I'm slightly questioning your file naming choices.....

#### Learning Competencies
Need rewording
May want to include some other competencies (alerts?)

#### Summary
.....idk how I feel about your wording Joseph :P 
How to frame resources?

#### Time to Squrit The Clown!
^ `Squirt`
Mention you'll need to view this in browser?
Need to check browser sizing on laptop screen (I'm assuming you want them to be in a line?)
Is that a branded clown I see?
I like that it says Squirt The Clown in the console!
This is hard to get going. Some guidance on how to approach? Not necessarily in what to do, but more where to start.
`a function that fires every time you click` reword and give suggestion of what do? (console.log)
`<title>JAVASCRIPT CARVINAL: Squirt The Clown!</title>` - feature or bug?
Pass `this` into function?
What is the range of the clowns? Do I end on three or after three? 
Is there a simpler way to code this?
Should I be led a little more into this?
Do i use info on the tag or in the file?
How would I do it if I didn't put the info in an object?

#### Reflection
What questions would you ask?

#### Stretch
Expand on the stretch. Pose more as suggestions?

Could we have a non clown version?

## whack-a-readme

#### Learning competencies
Same as the last learning competencies? But there was a huge list on the first readme!

#### Summary
Resources/intro length again

#### Whack! That! Mole!
Perhaps some words on what is currently there or to go and look at your file so that the tables suggestion and resource is in context.
Change `this shouldn't be too hard`
`create an indexer` - what do you mean by this?
Math.random link could be skipped?
I like that you include an example of functions, but could name them clearer
`*Remember,` - try maybe `Note:` or Remember to keep an eye blah blah blah
`style the #mole accordingly` - what am I doing? I feel like you have a plan here but I don't actually know it yet.
The css is for the whole carnival? I feel like there should be a main page too (`index.html`) if you really want to tie all these things together. 
`and quietly remind you that you are perfectly capable` - bit strong there
`By this point you should have a mole that appears in a random cell` - I do not thank you very much. Give the goal in the previous instruction rather than checking up on it in the next one. I put the images in, but don't yet have the random generator.
I could help you make these image backgrounds transparent if that's wanted.
That title on the pages needs some css-ing.

My steps:
- make mole img appear in all
- make invisible
- generate random number
- get div from cells thing 
- get child 
- toggle classlist

Could easily give each an id and getElementById.
There's so many ways to approach this, but some will remain the same. Maybe offer tools and then people construct plans themselves? Write that more overtly.

`shouldn't be too challenging because you can just re-use the functions you wrote` - wrote the first part as straight code rather than contained functions. This is often how I find peeps writing code when they first approach something too. 
Include more on what might need to happen in the onclick?
Change the order of the sound/function?

#### Reflection
Again, what qs?

#### Stretch
Pose as suggestions or bulk out more.
`Rewrite your RandomIndex() function` - assumption about how people approached it.
