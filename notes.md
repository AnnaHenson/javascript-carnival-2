# Notes on JS Carnival

Make sure .vs is out of your code @joseph!

## README.md
File should be in caps...

#### Learning Competencies
Learning competencies need to be broken up. 
Will this be in separate files like the kata or all in one?
Need to compare mine/calc learning competencies to these. Are there any key ones we're missing?
Edit competencies phrasing?

#### Summary
Love the intro. Could be expanded on to actually give overview of what will be required in challenge.

#### Timebox
This is a very short amount of time..... assuming it is replacing a 15/20 hour challenge(?). 
What will we be removing? How much content will there be?

#### The Games
love the context, needs rewording

#### Reflection
`and add your reflections` >>  `and answer the reflections` - they should already be there
