# Notes on JS Carnival

Make sure .vs is out of your code @joseph!
Only one clone which is nice, but idk how I feel about having it all in one repo. maybe positively?

## README
File should be in caps...
JS Carvinal..

#### Learning Competencies
Learning competencies need to be broken up. 
Will this be in separate files like the kata or all in one?
Need to compare mine/calc learning competencies to these. Are there any key ones we're missing?
Edit competencies phrasing?

#### Summary
Love the intro. Could be expanded on to actually give overview of what will be required in challenge.

#### Timebox
This is a very short amount of time..... assuming it is replacing a 15/20 hour challenge(?). 
What will we be removing? How much content will there be?
(Replacement for calc but keep minesweeper?)

#### The Games
love the context, needs rewording

#### Reflection
`and add your reflections` >>  `and answer the reflections` - they should already be there


## squirt-the-readme
I'm slightly questioning your file naming choices.....

#### Learning Competencies
Need rewording
May want to include some other competencies (alerts?)

#### Summary
.....idk how I feel about your wording Joseph :P 
How to frame resources?

#### Time to Squrit The Clown!
^ `Squirt`
Mention you'll need to view this in browser?
Need to check browser sizing on laptop screen (I'm assuming you want them to be in a line?)
Is that a branded clown I see?
I like that it says Squirt The Clown in the console!
This is hard to get going. Some guidance on how to approach? Not necessarily in what to do, but more where to start.
`a function that fires every time you click` reword and give suggestion of what do? (console.log)
`<title>JAVASCRIPT CARVINAL: Squirt The Clown!</title>` - feature or bug?
Pass `this` into function?
What is the range of the clowns? Do I end on three or after three? 
Is there a simpler way to code this?
Should I be led a little more into this?
Do i use info on the tag or in the file?
How would I do it if I didn't put the info in an object?

#### Reflection
What questions would you ask?

#### Stretch
Expand on the stretch. Pose more as suggestions?
