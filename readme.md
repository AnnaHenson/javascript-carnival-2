## The Games

These games are somewhat in order of difficulty, so try fixing them from top to bottom. 

[Inflate The Unicorn](./inflate-the-unicorn/inflate-the-unicorn-readme.md)  
These poor unicorns have baloons for horns. Write code that inflates them!

[Whack-A-Mole](./whack-a-mole/whack-a-mole-readme.md)  
The carnival classic "Whack a Mole" brought to life right inside your very own web browser. Where did all the moles go?

[Dress The Clown](./dress-the-clown/dress-the-clown-readme.md)  
A dressup game where you make a clown look fancy!
